# Learn Nano by Building a Castle

> Welcome to the Nano lessons!

## 10. Start the Terminal

### 10.1

**The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.** Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo hello nano` into the terminal and press enter.

#### HINTS

- Capitalization matters
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- If the tests don't run automatically, try typing `exit` into the terminal and redoing the instructions

## 20. Touch `castle.sh`

### 20.1

Use `touch` to create a file named `castle.sh` in the `project` folder.

#### HINTS

- Use the touch command to create the file
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- Try entering `touch castle.sh` in the terminal
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the project folder if you aren't there

## 25. List contents

### 25.1

Use the list (`ls`) command to make sure your file is there.

#### HINTS

- Type `ls` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the project folder if you aren't there

## 30. Nano `castle.sh`

### 30.1

There it is. Nano is a program for editing files that runs in the terminal. You can open a file with `nano filename`. Open the `castle.sh` file you created with Nano.

#### HINTS

- Type `nano castle.sh` in the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- You can exit nano by pressing `control + x` if you opened the wrong file

## 40. Write out `castle.sh`

### 40.1

The terminal is showing your file in Nano. At the bottom are the commands you can use. Your file is empty right now. Add `echo hello nano` at the top and press `control + o` to "write-out", or save, the file. You will be prompted at the bottom for a filename. Leave it as `castle.sh` and press enter to save the file.

#### HINTS

- Put `echo hello nano` at the top of the file, then press `control + o`, then `enter` to save the file
- Make sure the file was saved as `castle.sh`
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first

## 50. Exit

### 50.1

Exit Nano by pressing `control + x`.

#### HINTS

- Use `control + x` to exit nano
- Make sure you are in the `castle.sh` file before you exit
- Open the file with `nano castle.sh` if you need to open it first
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first

## 60. Run `castle.sh`

### 60.1

This will be a small bash script. You can run it with `bash filename`. Run your `castle.sh` file in the terminal.

#### HINTS

- Type `bash castle.sh` in the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first

## 70. Nano `castle.sh`

### 70.1

You can see the command in your file ran and output text into the terminal. Open your file again with nano.

#### HINTS

- Type `nano castle.sh` in the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first

## 80. Delete `echo hello nano`

### 80.1

You can "cut" text with `control + k`. Move the cursor to the line with your text and remove the whole line. When you are done, save the file with `control + o`. Note that you cannot use a mouse to move your cursor.

#### HINTS

- Remove the `echo hello nano` line of text and save the file
- Use `control + o` to save the file
- Press `enter` after `control + o` to save the file without changing the name
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first

## 90. Add `echo ""`

### 90.1

You are going to draw a castle that you can print to the terminal. Add `echo ""` to your file. Put an empty line in between the two quotes like this:

```
echo "

"
```

When you are done, save the file with `control + o`.

#### HINTS

- Your file should match the example
- Use `control + o` to save the file
- Press `enter` after `control + o` to save the file without changing the name
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first

## 100. Add the bottom row to castle

### 100.1

You will draw the castle between the quotes. Add ground level by putting 20 underscores (`_`) in the row between the quotes. It should look like this:

```
echo "
____________________
"
```

Save the file with `control + o` when you are done.

#### HINTS

- Your file should match the example
- Use `control + o` to save the file
- Press `enter` after `control + o` to save the file without changing the name
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first

## 110. Exit

### 110.1

The `^` in front of all the commands at the bottom means to press `control` and the letter to run the command. Exit Nano with the `Exit` command.

#### HINTS

- Use `control + x` to exit nano
- Make sure you are in the `castle.sh` file before you exit
- Open the file with `nano castle.sh` if you need to open it first

```sh
echo "
|____________________|
"
```

## 150. Add second row

### 150.1

Add another story to your castle above the ground level that has two more vertical bars. Each bar should be above your existing bars so you need spaces in between them. It should look like this:

```
|                    |
|____________________|
```

When you are done, save the file. 

#### HINTS

### 190.1

You can use `control + k` to "cut" and `control + u` to "uncut", or paste, a line. Add five more rows like the one you just added to make your castle six stories high. Try to use the cut and paste method. It should look like this:

```
|                    |
|                    |
|                    |

## 200. Add a roof to the castle

### 200.1

The existing top row is going to be the roof of the castle. Make it look like this:

```

## 210. Exit

### 210.1

The `M` at the beginning of the other commands at the bottom stands for "meta". It's a key that doesn't exist on most keyboards. If you're on OSX it means press `escape` then the letter. If you are on another system, press `ALT` then the letter. Use the exit command to get back to the terminal.

```sh
echo "
/  \              /  \
|  |______________|  |
|                    |

/  \              /  \
|  |______________|  |
|                    |
|                    |
|                    |

```

## 260. Exit

### 260.1

Go back to the terminal with the exit command.

#### HINTS

### 280.1

Oh no!! :open_mouth: Looks like a storm came through and blew the roof off! I think we can fix it. Open up the file.

#### HINTS

- Use the `nano` command to open your file
- Type `nano castle.sh` in the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first

## 290. Fix the roof

### 290.1

I'm not quite sure what happened here... Some of the `\` don't seem to be working. Try adding a space after the two `\` on the top right lookout tower. Put them where these `x`'s are:

```
 /\                /\x
/  \              /  \x
```

Maybe that will patch the roof. When you are done, save the file.

#### HINTS

- Put a space in place each `x` in the example
- Use `control + o` to save the file
- Press `enter` after `control + o` to save the file without changing the name
- If you are trying to reset, exit nano first
- The whole castle should look like this, but with spaces instead of `x`'s:
```sh
echo "
 /\                /\x
/  \              /  \x
|  |______________|  |
|                    |
|                    |
|                    |
|                    |
|____________________|

```sh
echo "
 /\                /\x
/  \              /  \x
|  |______________|  |
|                    |
